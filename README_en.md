# Background

A point cloud processing software based on [Open3D](http://www.open3d.org/) and [PyQt5](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/). Currently this project is not very functional, it can only read and visualize point cloud files, after that I will continue to update and improve the functionality. I welcome suggestions and help from developers who are committed to the open source community.

# Install

This project is implemented in Windows and requires [Open3D](http://www.open3d.org/) „ÄÅ [PyQt5](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/) and [VTK](https://vtk.org/). Please make sure you have the above libraries installed before using them.
